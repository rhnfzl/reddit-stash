# Reddit Stash

Reddit Stash is a Python script that automatically saves your Reddit saved posts and comments to your local machine or Dropbox. It uses GitHub Actions to run the script on a daily schedule for Dropbox.

## Features
- Downloads the saved Reddit folder from Dropbox.
- Automatically retrieves saved posts and comments from Reddit.
- Uploads the files to Dropbox for storage.
- Saves the content as markdown files.

## Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- A Dropbox account with an API token.
- Reddit API credentials.

### Installation

Before proceeding with any installation method, ensure that you have set the Reddit environment variables. Follow [this guide](#setting-up-reddit-environment-variables) to create a Reddit app and obtain the necessary credentials.

#### GitHub Action Installation

**Note:** The following process requires the [Dropbox App setup](#setting-up-dropbox-app). The GitHub Actions workflow runs the script daily at midnight CET, uploading the files to Dropbox. The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/reddit_scraper.yml`.

1. **Fork this repository**.

2. **Set Up Secrets:**
- Go to your forked repositoryâ€™s **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions** > Click on **New repository secret**.
- Add the following secrets individually:
    - `REDDIT_CLIENT_ID`
    - `REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET`
    - `REDDIT_USERNAME`
    - `DROPBOX_TOKEN` (for Dropbox)
- Enter the respective secret values without any quotes.

Example after adding all secrets: ![Repository Secrets](resources/repositiory_secrets.png).

3. **Manually Trigger the Workflow**:
- Go to the **Actions** tab > Select the **Reddit Stash Workflow** from the list on the left > Click **Run workflow** > Select the branch `main` > Click the green **Run workflow** button. The workflow will then be triggered, and you can monitor its progress in the Actions tab. Upon successful completion, you should see the Reddit folder in your Dropbox.

#### Local Installation

1. **Clone this repository**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/rhnfzl/reddit-stash.git
   cd reddit-stash
   ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Setup the [Dropbox App setup](#setting-up-dropbox-app). Skip it if you don't want to setup the dropbox and only want to save the file locally in your system.

4. Set Environment Variables:

    For macOS and Linux:
    ```
    export REDDIT_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
    export REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
    export REDDIT_USERNAME='your_username'
    export REDDIT_PASSWORD='your_password'
    export DROPBOX_TOKEN='dropbox-token'
    ```

    For Windows:

    ```
    set REDDIT_CLIENT_ID='your_client_id'
    set REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET='your_client_secret'
    set REDDIT_USERNAME='your_username'
    set REDDIT_PASSWORD='your_password'
    set DROPBOX_TOKEN='dropbox-token'
    ```
    
    You can verify the setup with:
    ```
    echo $REDDIT_CLIENT_ID
    echo $REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET
    echo $REDDIT_USERNAME
    echo $REDDIT_PASSWORD
    echo $DROPBOX_TOKEN
    ```

4. Usage:
    * First-time setup:
    ```
    python reddit_stash.py
    ```
    To upload to Dropbox:
    ```
    python dropbox_utils.py --upload
    ```
    * Subsequent runs, as per your convenience:
    1. Download from Dropbox:
    ```
    python dropbox_utils.py --download
    ```
    2. Process Reddit saved items:
    ```
    python reddit_stash.py
    ```
    3. Upload to Dropbox:
    ```
    python dropbox_utils.py --upload
    ```
