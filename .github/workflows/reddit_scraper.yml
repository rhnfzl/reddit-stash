    # TIMEZONE INFORMATION: 
    # - GitHub Actions uses UTC time for all cron schedules
    # - Netherlands is UTC+1 (CET) in winter and UTC+2 (CEST) in summer
    # - To convert from your local time to UTC: subtract your UTC offset (e.g., for Netherlands CEST: 14:00 CEST - 2 hours = 12:00 UTC)
    # - To convert from UTC to your local time: add your UTC offset (e.g., for Netherlands CEST: 12:00 UTC + 2 hours = 14:00 CEST)
    #
    # ADJUSTING FOR YOUR TIMEZONE:
    # 1. Determine your timezone's UTC offset (examples: US Eastern = UTC-4/5, Japan = UTC+9, UK = UTC+0/1)
    # 2. For desired local time X, set the UTC time to: X - (your UTC offset)
    # 3. Update both cron expressions below with your calculated UTC times
    
    # Higher frequency during Netherlands peak hours (8:00-23:00 CEST = 6:00-21:00 UTC)
    - cron: "0 6-21/2 * * *"  # Every 2 hours during peak hours (converts to 8:00-23:00 Netherlands time in summer)
    
    # Lower frequency during Netherlands off-peak hours
    - cron: "0 23,3 * * *"    # Twice during off-peak (converts to 1:00 and 5:00 Netherlands time in summer)
